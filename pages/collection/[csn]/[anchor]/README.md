# Collection View
The Collection-Endpoint, displays a DigitalSoul and provides soul-specific interactions.

## Security
Anchors are unguessable (due to big universe). Therefore, w/o knowing the anchor, this endpoint cannot be exploited practically to find so-far unpublished Digital Souls. Hence, displaying the public information of a DigitalSoul without any additional authorization does not pose any security risk.

For transaction authorization (ownership-claim etc), typically Attestation-Tokens are used.
