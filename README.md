# metaanchor

A frontend to work with Authentic Vision Meta Anchor (tm) Technology

## Codebase

### Technologies

The project is **full-stack Javascript**: meaning that the whole frontend is
powered by React, via Next.js, and all APIs are also built with it as well.
Here's a list of all technologies we use:

- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage
- **NextAuth**: For session & authentication
- **Prisma**: Persistence layer
- **React**: Frontend

## Hacking

The first step to run MetaAnchor locally is to grab a copy of the repository via
Git:

`git clone https://github.com/authenticvision/metaanchor`

*Tip: it is preferable to use SSH to connect, since it'll give you the option to
push in case you're a maintainer.*

### Preparing the environment

There are a couple of major steps to get your instance running:

1. **Install Docker & docker-compose**: See the [Docker documentation][docker]
   for instructions on installing it with your OS.
2. **Install the MetaMask Browser Extension**: For signin, at the moment, we
   only provide support for authentication with MetaMask. [See the instructions
   for your browser here][metamask]
3. **Apply for a DevKit**: You'll require having a MetaAnchor API Key for
   communicating with the MetaAnchor API. [Apply for one here][devkit]

[metamask]: https://metamask.io/download
[devkit]: https://www.authenticvision.com/mac

After completing these steps, you'll be ready to move on üíØ

### Getting the instance up

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**

At the moment, the project is under heavy development. Stuff might break and the
database schema is not fully completed and can go through changes. YMMV.

#### Fill the environment variables

First of all, we'll have to place our MetaAnchor key as environment variables.
There's a couple of ways to do that, we'll use the `.env` approach. So let's
copy the `.env.sample` file into a local, git-ignored file, on your nearest
terminal tab, inside the project folder:

`cp .env.sample .env.local`

Open this configuration file on your favorite editor and fill it in.

#### Build the containers

Now we need to get the containers ready to go, using docker:

`docker-compose build`

This might take a while, it'll grab the PostgreSQL image and build another image
for our application to live. After that's done, we can spin up our instance:

`docker-compose up`

*Tip: use the -d flag to run the detached mode, you can follow the logs later by
using `docker-compose logs -f`*

Great, now the metaanchor instance is running under `http://localhost:3000`.

*Tip: If you ever need to change the DB, you can (1) spin up a shell inside the
metaanchor container: `docker-compose exec metaanchor sh` (2) do a Prisma's push
command, optionally forcing a reset of the data: `yarn run db:push` or `yarn run
db:reset`*
